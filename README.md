The Long Dark - Snowfox companion mod - v0.9.8 by Digitalzombie
===============================================================

How to install:
===============
1. Download and install "Melon Loader" by HerpDerpinstine
https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/
This creates a new folder named "Mods" in your TLD folder.

2. Extract everything from the ZIP file to your new TLD\Mods folder (overwrite old files)

3. Players who are upgrading to the latest version from an earlier version need to delete the "FoxCompanion.json" file from their mod folder first, otherwise the mod will not appear in game.

4. Download and install "ModSettings"-Mod by zeobviouslyfakeacc:
https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModSettings/releases/latest

5. Start the game!  

=============================================
=============================================

How to use:
===========
1. Fox spawns automatically 2 seconds after you get in the game or transition to a new scene 
(eg. getting indoors/outdoors)

2. You can customize options (controls etc) in the ModSettings menu found under: 
Main Menu -> Options -> Mod Settings -> Fox settings

3. Toggle follow-mode by pressing the "Follow Player / Stop (Toggle)" key on your keyboard

4. Teleport fox directly to you by pressing the "Teleport" key on your keyboard 
Useful if fox gets stuck or you lost it somewhere.

5. Enter target & command mode by pressing the "Enable command mode" button. 
Aim in the general direction of a target. A red sphere appears above targeted rabbits, a green one above items.
Press the left mouse button to order the fox to hunt the rabbit or fetch the item.
Press the right mouse button to cancel the command mode.


How to customize your own textures:
===========
1. Go to your TLD folder and locate the Mods\foxtures folder.

2. You can edit any texture file located there and save it as a png file with the same name, but
I recommend leaving the default textures and using the "customX.png" files instead.
You can use any picture editing program.

3. Change and apply the texture in the settings menu.
